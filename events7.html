  <h3><strong><i>Dreaming on a Dreamless Reality</i> by Hyperlink</strong></h3>
	<p>
	At Hot Wheels, YGRG156 will read together with the audience a text Venus in Two Acts
 	by Saidiya Hartman. Alongside, there will be a screening of YGRG 14X: reading with a single hand (2018, 30
 	min) film by Dorota Gawęda and Eglė Kulbokaite.
 	</p>

	<p>
	The experience of collective reading extended into the domain of live performance and
	self- documentation, mediated through the Internet, social media and immersive
	installation is documented and contextualised in the film. The readers inhabit spaces
	constructed by YGRG in relation to our chosen texts as they read from mobile devices,
	strange landscapes and animated elements interfere. These constructions suggest a
	physical augmentation of the text and offer a focus for considering the relationship
	between the body of the performer, the text being read and the surrounding environment.
	Dorota Gawęda and Eglė Kulbokaitė are an artist duo based in Athens (GR) and Basel
	(CH). Both are graduates of Royal College of Art in London. In their work they address
	feminist inspired theory and fiction, technology-driven emancipation and discursiveness
	of space. Founders of Young Girl Reading Group (2013- ), with this project, Gawęda and
	Kulbokaitė investigate the act of reading as an intimate experience, becoming public
	performance through the “outlouding” of words. They have previously exhibited at Palais
	de Tokyo, Paris; Amanda Wilkinson Gallery, London; Galerie Barbara Weiss, Berlin;
	Kunstverein Freiburg; CAC, Vilnius; Kunsthalle Basel; ICA, London; SMK, Kopenhagen;
	de Appel, Amsterdam; Kunstverein für die Rheinlande und Westfalen, Düsseldorf;
	MOMA, Warsaw; SALTS, Basel; Berlin Biennale 9; CCS Bard, NY; Kunsthalle Zürich; Le
	Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris among others. Upcoming shows include:
	YGRG 14X: reading with a single hand V solo exhibition at Cell Project Space, London;
	6th Moscow Biennale For Young Art, MMOMA; Musée d’Orsay as part of Wild Souls.
	Symbolism in the Baltic States; 13th Baltic Triennial, Tallinn; Welt ohne Außen -
	Immersive Spaces since the 1960s, Martin Gropius Bau; Still I Rise, Nottingham
	Contemporary; 6th Athens Biennale.

 	Helena Koursou, also known as Noff Weezy, was born and is currently based in Athens.
 	She spent her most important years in London where she studied graphic design,
 	explored dance, club & rave culture and later developed further her aesthetics and
 	relationship with music. Helena has seen herself balancing between edges throughout
 	the years. She works hard plays hard in the fields of music, design and media from a
 	very young age as a graphic designer, DJ, radio producer and music editor. Her
 	influences root mainly from the 80s, 90s and today, creating a trippy feeling of nostalgia
 	in her sets, as well as a desire for expression. Mixing styles like house, bass, breakbeat,
 	electro, techno, acid, UK garage, tribal, disco, tropical, experimental, ambient and post
 	sounds, she encapsulates the vibe of good old days, modern times and tomorrow's
 	curiosities. She is hosting a radio show as Noff Weezy every Wednesday 20:00-22:00 on
 	Cannibal Radio. In the context of Hyperlink's Accidental Encounters: Dreaming on a dreamless reality,
 	she will be escaping her DJ identity using her real name instead, in order to avoid any
 	distances. Experimenting with a Roland SP-404 sampling workstation for the first time,
 	she will be performing an improvisational sound collage of spontaneous accidents.

    Georgios Karamanolakis, is an experimental artist and composer-improviser who lives in
 	Athens. He continuously ''activates'' a wide range of sounds that originate from monolithic
 	drones and end up in noise walls mixed with elements of free jazz and musique concrete,
 	using many -modified and not- analogue and digital synthesizers, field recordings and
 	tapes, metallic objects and various electroacoustic techniques. He is influenced by the
 	culture of mysticism, experimental films and the aesthetics of the past, which at any given
 	age can become the future. He is the leading mind behind the Athenian cult, post-
 	apocalyptic synth-punk band ΟΔΟΣ 55. He is a member of the underground urban
 	intervention team OMIO, a group active in outdoor interventions in the urban fabric as
 	well as in film recordings of hidden locations such as train cemeteries, underground
 	tunnels, and war shelters. He has cooperated and composed albums with a wide range
 	of experimental artists such as Japanese noise legend Hiroshi Hasegawa (Astro) and
 	musique concrete master Jean – Marc Foussat (their last work beeing the 12'' vynil lp
 	Substunce Sans Scrupule ) amongst others. He is the producer of the Athens Inner City
 	Broadcast program at the London Resonance FM experimental radio station.

	MarcelDune is an experimental electronic music artist based in Athens, Greece.
	By combining analog and digital sounds in addition to field recordings (including various
	techniques and knowledge that has been gained from jazz studies at the Athens
	conservatory and opera singing), a rather unique style is being utilized in order to create
	such an experimental approach to music.
	</p>

	<p>
	This musical style and talent has paved the way for performing various live shows
	including Ride Cycle Culture Cafe in Chania, Crete alongside many accomplished
	electronic musicians, and a more art-oriented project in collaboration with a local
	experimental dance group which made its debut at Communitism; a repurposed
	abandoned building that has been transformed into a socio-cultural project, and it's
	sophomore act at the St. Paul's Anglican Church. The essence of these performances is
	about the current 'Noise Generation', and consists of a fluidity each time forming variably
	depending on the environment which it is being held, the time, the people involved, and
	each individual's feelings. MarcelDune's first LP record soon to be released.
