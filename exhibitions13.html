  <h3><strong><i>(a) Collaboration</i><br>Nicholas Cheveldave & Sebastian Lloyd Rees</strong></h3></h3>

  <p>(a) collaboration

Audre Lorde speaks about the erotic as a quality that engages power and love, as a dynamic force for staying with the raptures and sorrows of the quotidian. (a) collaboration looks with these essences by thinking across the resonances, the amplifications and the transpatial communications of synergies occuring at the same time. The works become with one another, enact the amorphous schemes of simultaneity, break concrete chronicles, rearrange the semantics and connotations coming with one’s limits of identity. Through their discrepancies, they create spaces of disruption, unruly visions, moments of pleasure, chasms in the systems of ownership.

~

whim: a sudden desire or change of mind, especially one that is unusual or unexplained

as

the intermediate or suspended state 
destroying the fixated penetrating 
the unknown
the vernacular against the matrix 
of visual representations realms in fragments
reversed or naked
it is all based in a fantasy of dispersed futures


limbo

~

I know nothing about your pasts

~

to stop the time
or to witness it otherwise
you know that tentacular thinking means to keep your eyes wide open
but only for one second 

your f’s start from fluctuation
they end to fear not, willful feasts and fingers and tongues
invading the ego

I had a dream about Italian abandoned places

I could not walk I could only levitate
shuttered eggs releasing a transparent odorless smoke
elusive gods capable of turning everything into water 
and some other frames

What should frontiers exclude 
cities and more complex architectural syntaxes 
of souls 
and bodies and possessions,
Para-fictions, 
or para-identities, 
or para-topias
A woman crazy but wise once told me: I’m not a judge

~

when I write about you I try to read you and come closer and love 
you in many ways 
there is a language 
yet 
unspoken, transparent, visually elliptic
an idiolect uttered by the rotted
the one that has been decomposed 
it reveals both torments and euphorias 

think of this idiolect as an organ
a newly born part of your body
the organic form is replicated, mimicked or converged with 
the somaticality of the making

think of the body as an archive

a ghostly knowledge

poetry

~

trail: a mark or a series of signs or objects left behind by the passage of someone or something
or to move wearily

uncertainty is a scheme for transcribing what lingers over interpersonal dynamics 

there are some politics embodied, somatisised,
how you find them first, collect them after, 
how you edit them, subvert them and let them circulate, 
how you allow them to generate heterotopias, 
and how they eventually turn into autonomous entities 
curving out 

alternative places of sociability

~

there is a word I’m thinking about lately
that is aberration, I’m thinking about it only because it is inclusive, it falls for the spaces and the times in between, I’ve only noticed your presence when you stroked these othernesses,

when I asked you how to calculate the one that always flows 
I killed the question mark

metaphors are movements and movements are transformations,
a-structural structures in a narrative condensed, 
sites of resistance
unflattened marks of violence

to observe first and speculate after
to imagine always, to get lost and to never be found through constellations of lights and darks, mythopoetics have an agency on their own

recounting cognition 
across alternation
disorderly others
many yous and multiple Is
