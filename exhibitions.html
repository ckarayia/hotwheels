    <strong><i><a href="exhibitions4.html">Marzanna, Yours Again</a></i><br>Zoe Paul and Faye Wei Wei</strong></h3>

    <p>Opening: Tuesday, January 16th<br>On until Sunday, February 11th</p>  

    <p class='italic'> At the end of winter, children gather to drown the Marzanna in the closest lake, marking the beginning of a new spring.

    <br>
    <br>

    Marzanna dolls, representative of the Baltic and Slavic goddess associated with seasonal rites, are created only to be destroyed.Part of a folk tradition that has stood the test of time, communities in Eastern Europe come together on the first day of spring to create their own effigy. Marzanna has become a malleable symbol; freed from her historical and sacred significance, she is a vessel for expressing personal mythologies and an embodiment of new beginnings. The works of Faye Wei Wei and Zoe Paul engage with the visual weaving of their own individual narratives. Their work references both practical and visual histories, developing a language that combines the then and the now. When these narratives are unwoven, and the Marzanna drowned, only traces of symbols remain to guide an exploration.</p>

    </h3>

    <p>Opening: Wednesday, November 22nd<br>On until Sunday, December 17th</p> 

    <p class='italic'> A year ago, Lindsay Lohan embarked on a joint venture in Athens; LOHAN, a new nightclub in the heart of the Athenian party scene in Gazi. Lindsay’s role in the club was puzzling—her newfound presence in the Greek nightlife market was tinged with mystery, and rumours started to circulate. Lohan’s interview only perpetuated the mystery further; she expressed how, in the light of the refugee crisis, xenophobia, and the country’s debt, LOHAN was her gift to Greece. Marketed as a nightclub for all, the appeal drew on the promise of a quasi-spiritual experience; a place for having fun, a way to ‘take bad situations and make it good’. Lohan heralded herself as the goddess of Athenian night life, elevating herself, and the clubbers, through a sanctified premium dance experience. 

    <br>
    <br>

    Through the prism of Lindsay Lohan and her namesake club, the exhibition draws links between ancient mythology, celebrity and the symbolism of the club experience in the context of modern day Athens. </p>
