    <p>Opening: Tuesday, November 13th<br>On until Saturday, December 23rd 2018

    <p class='italic'> 
    At the Foyer of Purgatoryis a physical space of the mind for all those who wander, where one canwarmly gather,sit and chat,as if it was my own house, while those who favour solitude can spend timein meditation. I’m very curious to listen to what my guests will have to say, to observe the motion of this contemporary Foucault’s pendulum between catharsis and annihilation, keeping an open mind towards both cigarettes and palo santo, while we sip on a Yogi tea—or do you reckon we should go for dirty Martinis?

    <br>Vasilis  Papageorgiou
    <br>
    Texts  by:  James  Bridle,  Danai  Giannoglou,  Paky  Vlassopoulo
    </strong></h3>

    <p>Opening: Tuesday, September 25th<br>On until Saturday, November 3rd 2018

    <p class='italic'> 
    Papageorgiou  has  synthesised  his  open  enquiry  from  places  of  gathering  and  community  into  a  sculptural  deconstruction  of  the  bar,  one  of  the  epicentres  of  the  modern  social  space.  Presenting  homogenous  elements  of  the  bar,  he  recalls  popular  counterculture  through  exploring  past  times,  prompting  a  sentiment  to  Athenian  nightlife  culture.    This  body  of  work  weaves  together  the  traits  and  affects  of  social  groups  that  seem  suspended  between  reality  and  fiction.  Papageorgiou  articulates  the  ecology  of  the  bar  at  an  anthropological  level;  the  traces  left  behind  by  its  characters,  and  factual  or  fictitious  elements  of  the  myths  that  surround  these  people.  Although  its  identity  is  only  traced  and  mimicked  through  the  tangible,  works  are  articulated  through  the  narratives  of  characters  that  are  as  elusive  as  ghosts.

      <p class='italic'> 
      A group exhibition organized by Gerasimos Floratos in collaboration with Yeson Art Center Yeson is a non-profit organization based in Seoul, South Korea that provides studios, materials, and tuition to artists working and living with developmental disabilities. In 2016 a dialogue began between myself and the director of Yeson Art Center, Jimin Han, where different possibilities for a collaborative project with Yeson were discussed. In early 2017 Ms. Han visited my studio in New York and selected a group of works on paper to be used as materials by artists affiliated with the program. Once in Seoul, the selected work was distributed amongst the art supplies provided to the artists by the center. Over the next year and a half, the artists worked directly on top of the pre-existing imagery. The final works have not been changed in any way since their completion by the artists in Seoul.

    <p>Opening: Thursday, April 12th<br>On until Saturday, May 5th 2018</p>  

    <p class='italic'> In 1172 the third column of Venice arrived in San Marco Square from the East. The column is thought to be 16 meters in height and 70 tones in weight. During its passage to the present day, the column was inexplicably misplaced; drowned within the depths of the Adriatic Sea, the monument’s factuality has been drifting from accurate history since.

    <br>
    <br>

    Following the school of archaeologists and researchers, whose aims are to localise this sunken Byzantine artefact, Nicola Baratto and Yiannis Mouravas continued this research. By wandering, digging and recollecting memories they have developed the practice of archaeodreaming.</p>

    <strong><i><a href="exhibitions4.html">Marzanna, Yours Again</a></i><br>Zoe Paul and Faye Wei Wei</strong></h3>

    <p>Opening: Tuesday, January 16th<br>On until Sunday, February 11th 2018</p>  

    <p class='italic'> At the end of winter, children gather to drown the Marzanna in the closest lake, marking the beginning of a new spring.

    <br>
    <br>

    Marzanna dolls, representative of the Baltic and Slavic goddess associated with seasonal rites, are created only to be destroyed.Part of a folk tradition that has stood the test of time, communities in Eastern Europe come together on the first day of spring to create their own effigy. Marzanna has become a malleable symbol; freed from her historical and sacred significance, she is a vessel for expressing personal mythologies and an embodiment of new beginnings. The works of Faye Wei Wei and Zoe Paul engage with the visual weaving of their own individual narratives. Their work references both practical and visual histories, developing a language that combines the then and the now. When these narratives are unwoven, and the Marzanna drowned, only traces of symbols remain to guide an exploration.</p>

    <p>Opening: Wednesday, November 22nd<br>On until Sunday, December 17th 2017</p> 

    <p class='italic'> A year ago, Lindsay Lohan embarked on a joint venture in Athens; LOHAN, a new nightclub in the heart of the Athenian party scene in Gazi. Lindsay’s role in the club was puzzling—her newfound presence in the Greek nightlife market was tinged with mystery, and rumours started to circulate. Lohan’s interview only perpetuated the mystery further; she expressed how, in the light of the refugee crisis, xenophobia, and the country’s debt, LOHAN was her gift to Greece. Marketed as a nightclub for all, the appeal drew on the promise of a quasi-spiritual experience; a place for having fun, a way to ‘take bad situations and make it good’. Lohan heralded herself as the goddess of Athenian night life, elevating herself, and the clubbers, through a sanctified premium dance experience. 

    <br>
    <br>

    Through the prism of Lindsay Lohan and her namesake club, the exhibition draws links between ancient mythology, celebrity and the symbolism of the club experience in the context of modern day Athens. </p>
