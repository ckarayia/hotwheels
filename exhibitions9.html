  <h3><strong><i>WHEN THE SUN GOES UP: BAR STORIES IN 3 ACTS</i><br>Vasilis Papageorgiou</strong></h3></h3>

  <p>Texts by: James Bridle, Danai Giannoglou, Paky Vlassopoulou</p>

  <p>Papageorgiou  has  synthesised  his  open  enquiry  from  places  of  gathering  and  community  into  a  sculptural  deconstruction  of  the  bar,  one  of  the  epicentres  of  the  modern  social  space.  Presenting  homogenous  elements  of  the  bar,  he  recalls  popular  counterculture  through  exploring  past  times,  prompting  a  sentiment  to  Athenian  nightlife  culture.</p>

  <p>This  body  of  work  weaves  together  the  traits  and  affects  of  social  groups  that  seem  suspended  between  reality  and  fiction.  Papageorgiou  articulates  the  ecology  of  the  bar  at  an  anthropological  level;  the  traces  left  behind  by  its  characters,  and  factual  or  fictitious  elements  of  the  myths  that  surround  these  people.  Although  its  identity  is  only  traced  and  mimicked  through  the  tangible,  works  are  articulated  through  the  narratives  of  characters  that  are  as  elusive  as  ghosts.</p>
