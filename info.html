<h3>WHAT WE ARE ABOUT</h3>
    
<p> Our plan is to have two programs. <br><br>
 One  will  be  a  conventional  space  at  our  apartment,  where  we  want  to  show predominantly  young  artists  in  a  combination  of  solo  and  group  shows.  The apartment setting will allow for a more engaged art viewing experience, where the less  formal  home  setting  will  create  a  more  relaxed  atmosphere.  The  art space  itself  will  have  minimal  viewer  interference,  being  as  close  to  a  white cube as possible, within the neo classical space. <br><br>
  The  other  programme  will  be  more  experimental,  where  we will  organise temporary  and  interdisciplinary  happenings  that  wonâ€™t  be  publicised  online. Instead, we  will experiment by using offline advertising forms, such as radio, street  advertising,  magazines,  and  word  of  mouth.  The  happenings  will  be documented  in  zine  form,  with  the  intention  to  build  up  a  library  of  material that will be accessible at the apartment gallery space. The zines will also be available on the website, as it is necessary to be generous towards the artists and the public</p><br><br>
