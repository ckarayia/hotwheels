<!-- <h3>WHAT WE ARE ABOUT</h3> -->
    
<p> Hot Wheels Projects is a curatorially led project space in Athens, Greece.   
<br><br>
 Established by Julia Gardener and Hugo Wheeler, Hot Wheels Projects is located in their home, on the periphery of Exarcheia. Hugo and Julia live in the apartment with their trusted guard dog, Gigi, and friendly neighbours, Delia and Buggy Gonzalez. 
 <br><br>
  The  other  programme  will  be  more  experimental,  where  we will  organise temporary  and  interdisciplinary  happenings  that  won’t  be  publicised  online. Instead, we  will experiment by using offline advertising forms, such as radio, street  advertising,  magazines,  and  word  of  mouth.  The  happenings  will  be documented  in  zine  form,  with  the  intention  to  build  up  a  library  of  material that will be accessible at the apartment gallery space. The zines will also be available on the website, as it is necessary to be generous towards the artists and the public.
  <br><br>
The project was born out of their affinity, and has continued in the same vein. Delia, an artist, musician, and good friend, had just moved into her new home and brought Hugo to view the vacant place below. The apartment had gone through several guises; a family home in the 60s, embassy in the 70s, and a sex shop in the early 2000s.  The neo-classical building, looking over one of Athens’ most infamous landmarks, is a special place. Hugo knew he had to have it.  
<br><br>
Today, the neighbours share everything, from the wi-fi and washing machine to the tottering rooftop, and actively support each other’s endeavours. So, there we have it- a few friends, living in a home, putting on some shows.   
<br><br>
Hot Wheels Projects runs two programmes. 
<br><br>
The duo holds exhibitions in their flat. It’s a big, open space, giving them a lot to work with. Much of the apartment has been stripped down, leaving only the stucco ceilings and a big bookshelf, which adorns the white cube space. That bookshelf is now affectionately called the house library. 
<br><br>
This paved the way for the second programme and Julia’s baby, Hot Heels Publications. The zine series documents happenings that are varied in nature, ranging from film screenings to club nights and performances. If you want to see them cover-to-cover, go and pay the team a visit- I’m sure they can dig around the ‘library’ to find them. But if you can’t make it, don’t worry- you can also find the scans online. 
<br><br>
Although the zines are shared online, Hot Heels Publications is really about pushing the content ‘offline’. Instead, they advertise in the real world: posters, radio announcements, match boxes and, most importantly, word of mouth. 
<br><br>
We are living in a highly dazed world, where we see artwork as a commodity, especially one to be consumed. Other commodities in this world tend to have a life span, be it a new phone, Birkenstock sandals, or even a glass of Raki, as we continue looking for the next best thing. However, when viewing an artwork, you can’t look at it in the same way. Artistic production should be extensively pursued and contemplated. By not becoming another Facebook event that your algorithms demand you to ‘attend’, through Hot Heels Publications, Hot Wheels Projects are doing their bit in stopping the world from becoming digitally, comfortably numb.
