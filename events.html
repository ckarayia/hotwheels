    <p class='italic'>
    An evening of multidisciplinary artists sharing their unfinished performances. This evening is meant to ignite a critical conversation between the viewer and the maker.  An open space for viewing, listening, sharing, reflecting, and creating a dialogue within the artistic community of Athens.  <i>Based on Performance</i> is curated by Zoja Smutny, hoping to ignite a critical feedback conversation about performance in the gallery. There are four works that will be presented, each 20min long. Once the works have been presented, we invite you to stay and talk with us about these works in process.

    <strong><i>On the Run: Ecologies of Gaze</i> by hd.kepler.
    <br>Mirela Baciak, Bikini, DEDAZO, hd.kepler., Montecristo Project, Eleni Riga, SUPER </strong></h3>

    <p>February 17th 2018</p> 

    <p class='italic'>
    Ecologies of Gaze is conceived as a study of attention through the spectrum of proximity and care. The departure point was the book “For an Ecology of Attention” where the thinker, Yves Citton, uses the theory of the economists George Franck and Maurice Goldhaber considering attention as a currency. Citton proposes a change of direction from the “One” to the “Other” and from the “We” to our environment. We have asked artists and curators how they practice attention in a world governed by automatism.
    <br>
    How do we practice attention at an unconventional exhibition space in a lighthouse in Sardinia or in a residency in the jungle of Chiapas, in a nomadic space moving from Εurope or in an exhibition space always presenting one or two artworks (bikini or monokini)?

    <p class='italic'>
    An evening of readings, videos and performances from a group of artists working through the embodiment of voice, inscription and linguistic dynamics. Exploring the haptics of auto-ethnographic writing, found text and technology-assisted transcription, the event features diverse schemas of approaching voicing, mouthing and speaking through self and others.
